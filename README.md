## Configuration
![Screenshot 5](images/screenshot5.png)
<br>If you want [gsimplecal](https://github.com/dmedvinsky/gsimplecal) to open below clicked date, configure position of window in gsimplecal configuration:
```
mainwindow_position = none
mainwindow_xoffset = 1642
mainwindow_yoffset = 0
```

## Keybindings
### TL;DR Default + custom
Every action from default qtile config is integrated in here for general use, but I added some more:
- "mod" + "a"/"d" - When in Max layout you can move focus to different windows.
- "mod" + "e" - To open Pcmanfm (or any file manager of your choice).
- "mod" + "s" - To open Rofi to easy search for applications.
- "mod" + "c" - To open Vscodium.
- "mod" + "f" - To open Firefox.
- "mod" + "g" - To open Pavucontrol.

## Mouse callbacks
### TL;DR Many mouse callbacks in the bar
Most of widgets on the bar have actions assigned to mouse (using left mouse click):
- Layout Icon - Change layout.
- GroupBox - Change workspace.
- Tasklist - Change fucused window.
- System tray - Interact with programs on system tray.
- Mpris2 (spotify player) - Play/pause music.
- Update list - Open terminal in a new window, and update system.
- NvidiaSensors - Informations about Nvidia GPU.
- CPU - Open sensors (temperature for CPU and other parts)
- Memory - LEFT: Open htop, RIGHT: Open free.
- Net - Show network configuration.
- Date and hour - Open calendar beneath.
- üóò - Restart system.
- ‚èº - Shutdown system.

## Issues
There are some issues:
- Problem: If you open an application in Max layout, it won't add to tasklist and just obey A-D "arrows", it will go after window, in which you opened it. Solution: Restart qtile (Mod + Ctrl + R) 
- Problem: After restarting Qtile, Mpris2 won't display currently playing track. Solution: Go to the next song, and return.
- Problem: Updates fairly rarely show how many updates there are, but update interval is set to 0,5 hour. Solution: It defeats all purpouse, but you need to update it manually.

## TODO
Some minor changes, maybe add Qtile-extras support.
