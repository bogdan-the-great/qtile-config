### [Previous powerline config:](https://github.com/piotr-marendowski/arch-dotfiles/tree/main/Qtile%20powerline)
![config2](assets/screenshots/powerline.png)

## Note:
INCLUDING [QTILE EXTRAS](https://qtile-extras.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - please set it up before using this config. Should configure properly, and according to the documentation before using, this isn't out-of-the-box config, but most of it is already pre-configured.

## Features:
Everything in one config.py file, assets provided for images. Images are "connected" to widgets using the same color decorations. Volume icon changing with volume levels. Default layouts: Max, Columns, and Floating. Mpris scrolling, mouse callbacks on: Tags, Tasklist, Mpris (stops music), Volume (mutes), Clock (runs Gsimplecal if installed), CurrentLayout (changes layouts), reboot and shutdown buttons. 

## Troubleshooting:
If Mpris2 doesn't work [check this](https://github.com/elParaguayo/qtile-extras/issues/224).

If there isn't a volume icon, just reload the config. It have something to do with volume icon changing with volume levels.
